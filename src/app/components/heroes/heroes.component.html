    Pipes are a good way to format strings, currency amounts, dates, and other display data. 
    Angular ships with several built-in pipes, and you can create your own.

<h2>{{ hero.name | uppercase }} Details</h2>
<div>
    <label for="name">Hero name: </label>

    <input id="name" [(ngModel)]="hero.name" placeholder="name">
  </div>

  <!-- 
    The ngModel directive in Angular is used for two-way data binding between the view and the model. 
    It allows you to bind the value of an HTML input, select, or textarea element to a property in the 
    component class. This means that changes in the view will update the model, and changes in the model 
    will update the view automatically.
